# Halo RPG!
A jQuery game with a Halo theme!

## How it was built

I built this game with HTMl/CSS Bootstrap. Jquery and Javascript determine the game logic and flow. 

This game used Jquery to populate the HTML and define onclick events for the character cards and attack buttons. A combination of Jquery and Javascript determined the game flow/logic.
